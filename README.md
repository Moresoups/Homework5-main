# Homework5-main

This project was created for a homework assignmet in which we had to create a work day scheduler that showed the past, present and future seperated by color. 

Majority of the HTML index is mine, starter code gave the rest. the whole of the Style.css file is starter code besides the purple I added to the hover. all of the JavaScript is mine.
